Vladimir Antanov has fled the country with his girlfriend Sonya. My company employed Antanov to maintain our critical communication systems. We urgently need to add a new feature the the existing software, and knowing you are a Master Java Developer we have chosen you to modify the software to communicate with our new clients.

Please find attached the project and source code. Currently the system processes notifications and sends them to email, database or a web service. We need to add another endpoint - JMS.

The JMS connection requires configuration details:
- Server Name
- Port
- Queue Name

You have one day to create a new fork of the project and apply your changes. Once complete please post the URL for your fork.

Note: We don't expect an actual JMS connector - follow the same pattern as the existing senders which simply output to the console.
